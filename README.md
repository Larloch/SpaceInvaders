# STOS - Coding Challenge \
\
SpaceInvaders in three days.
\
## Autor Notes \
\
Considering the limited time available for the challenge, and the various requirements that needed to be met, I had an initial "make it work" approach to development. \
The version of the code in the `master` branch (and also in the `FedericoSpinardi_Test` banch), reflects my style when I need to be fast. For this reason you will find there Singleton classes, no use of interfaces and no unit tests. \
After finishing I decided to invest the remaining time (half a day, more or less) in the implementation of a "ServiceLocator", in this way I have been able to eliminate the use of Singletons and I have been able to realize a couple of demonstrative Unit Tests. \
Since these changes required some refactoring, I left a branch called `FedericoSpinardi_ServiceLocator` where you can view these code updates. \


I want to conclude with a heartfelt thank you for allowing me to take on this challenge, this was the first time I've tackled 2D game development, but aside from some minor initial doubts, I really enjoyed the experience! \
